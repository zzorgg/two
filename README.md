## 🆕 Updated for Solana Kit, Kite, and Codama

[![CI Badge](https://github.com/mikemaccana/anchor-escrow-2025/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikemaccana/anchor-escrow-2025/actions)

**Start here for your first real Solana program / smart contract** (Solana generally uses the word 'program', older blockchains use 'smart contract'). As the saying goes, "All Solana programs are variations of an escrow." 

This makes **Anchor Escrow 2025** the perfect starting point for anyone diving into Solana program development with a practical, real-world application.

**Anchor Escrow 2025** provides:

- Full compatibility with the latest Rust, Agave CLI, Node.js, Anchor, and Solana Kit.
- Clean builds with zero warnings or errors.
- Testing via npm and Node.js, avoiding third-party package managers or test runners.

## Animated walk through

Check out the **full animated explanation** of the Escrow program from mySolana TURBIN3 video:

This repository is [designed for teaching and learning](CHANGELOG.md).

## Introduction

This Solana program implements an **escrow**, enabling secure token swaps between users. For example, Alice can offer 10 USDC in exchange for 100 WIF.

Without an escrow, users face significant risks:

- **Traditional finance** charges 1-6% in fees, eating into your funds.
- **Manual swaps** are prone to fraud. If Bob takes Alice's 10 USDC but doesn't send the 100 WIF, or if Alice fails to deliver after receiving Bob's tokens, someone gets burned.

The **Anchor Escrow 2025** program acts as a trusted intermediary, releasing tokens only when both parties meet the agreed terms. This ensures Alice and Bob each receive 100% of their desired tokens, securely and without middleman fees.
