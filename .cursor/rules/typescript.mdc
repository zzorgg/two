## Coding guidelines

There is an Anchor project in the 'programs/escrow' directory and tests in the 'tests' directory. You may only modify files in these folders.

Use a newline after each key in the account constraints, so the macro and the matching key/value have some space from other macros and their matching key/value.

Create files inside the 'state' folder for whatever state is needed.

Use 'context' rather than 'ctx'. Avoid abbreviations, and use full words. Never use 'e' for something thrown. In TypeScript, use `catch (thrownObject)` and then `const error = thrownObject as Error;` - you can assume any item thrown is an Error.

Delete unused constants, unused instruction handlers and comments that no longer apply.

Use 'context.bumps.foo' not 'context.bumps.get("foo").unwrap()' - the latter is outdated.

When making structs ensure strings and Vectors have a max_len attribute. Vectors have two numbers, the first is the max length of the vector, the second is the max length of the items in the vector.

Use the INIT_SPACE macro for all structs stored onchain. Make a constant for ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR that is a usize of 8. Do not use magic numbers. I don't want to see '8 + 32' or whatever. Do NOT use magic numbers. Do not make constants for the sizes of various data structures, you can use INIT_SPACE for this.

Create files inside the 'handlers' folder for whatever instruction handlers are needed. Put Account Constraints here, but ensure the names end with 'AccountConstraints' rather than just naming them the same thing as the function. Handlers that are only for the admin should be in a new folder called 'admin' inside the 'handlers' folder.

Create unit tests in TS in the 'tests' directory. Use 'test' rather than 'it'.

Don't do things like write '...implement the thing...' or '...test code for creating an event...'. Instead, make the actual code.

Use anchor_lang::solana_program::clock to get the current time where needed.

Return useful error messages. Write code to handle common errors like insufficient funds, bad values for parameters, and other obvious situations.

Remember this is Solana not Ethereum. Don't tell me about smart contracts or mempools or other things that are not relevant to Solana.

Add "pub bump: u8" to every struct stored in PDA. Save the bumps inside each when the struct inside the PDA is created.

Please the node js inbuilt test and assertion libraries (then start the tests using 'esrun' instead of 'ts-mocha'). Imports look like:

```typescript
import { before, describe, test, it } from "node:test";
import { assert } from "node:console";
```

Write all code like Anchor 0.30.1. Do not use unnecessary macros that are not needed in Anchor 0.30.1.

When you get the time via Clock, use 'Clock::get()?;' and do not use the Clock sysvar account.
