There is an Anchor project. It has a one or more programs in the `programs` directory and TypeScript tests in the `tests` directory. You may only modify files in these folders.

Don't do things like write `...implement the thing...` or `...test code for creating an event...`. Instead, make the actual code.

Remember this is Solana not Ethereum. Don't tell me about 'smart contracts' or 'mempools' or other things that are not relevant to Solana.
